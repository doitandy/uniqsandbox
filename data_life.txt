Biohacking: Inflammation ||| Health ||| Inflammation and aging are caused by Omega-6 and sugar. Avoid seed oils; embrace olive oil, avocado oil, and butter. If you are in your 50s, strength training solves most pain. [42], [33]
Parenting: No Conditional Love ||| Parenting ||| Do not give conditional praise like "You are good because you did this." Parental love should never be a threat. Separate your child's life from your own. [43], [31]
Sleep is Cleaning ||| Health ||| Sleep is not a waste of time; it's a cleaning process. You need at least 6 hours for the brain to flush out toxins. Program your subconscious before sleeping. [44]
Box Breathing ||| Wellness ||| Practice "Box Breathing": Inhale for 4s, hold for 7s, exhale for 8s. It resets your autonomic nervous system instantly. Do this when stressed. [38]
Diet: Ketogenic Approach ||| Health ||| Eat simple. Tofu, eggs, vegetables, and good fats. A ketogenic approach boosts metabolism. Stop eating when you are not hungry. [33]
Focus Limit: 45 Minutes ||| Productivity ||| The brain can only focus deeply for 45 minutes. Take breaks. Multitasking is a myth; it's just rapid task-switching that lowers IQ. [31]
Marriage and Fighting ||| Relationships ||| The person you marry is the person you will fight with. The house you buy is the house you will repair. Choose your struggles wisely. [40]
Cats and Boundaries ||| Relationships ||| Be like a cat. Don't beg for everyone's love. Only care about those you have chosen. If someone dislikes you, let them be. [28], [45]
Children's Boredom ||| Parenting ||| Don't force adult roles on children. Let them be bored; boredom fosters independence. Don't solve their problems immediately; wait and watch. [43], [31]
Communication Tone ||| Soft Skills ||| It's not just what you say, but how you say it. Tone matters. Even a correct statement can be rejected if the tone is aggressive. Match your speed to the listener. [21]
Empathy vs Sympathy ||| Emotional Intelligence ||| Empathy is choosing to care about another's pain despite your own. It is not just feeling sorry. It requires active participation. [35]
Throw It Away ||| Life Hack ||| If you keep something "just in case," you are betting on a negative future. Throw it away. Clear space invites new fortune. [33]
The Humor of Aging ||| Life ||| "I look young" is a compliment that means I missed the chance to take off my hat. Spend money on medicine instead of alcohol. Life is ironic, enjoy it. [12]
Space for Children ||| Parenting ||| Give children space and time. Don't rush to pull them out of a situation. Waiting is also a form of love. [43]
Be a buying agent ||| Business Mind ||| Like Trader Joe's, act as an agent for your customers, not just a seller. This mindset shifts how you select and present your value. [4]
Routine is Mental Strength ||| Mental Health ||| Mental strength isn't about not crying; it's about your routine not collapsing even when you cry. Keep your daily rhythm. [46]

Social Media Detox ||| Digital Health ||| Disconnecting for even a day resets your dopamine levels. Replace scrolling with reading or walking. [12]
Exercise for 50s ||| Health ||| In your 50s, surgical pain is often solved by muscle. Focus on squats and lower body strength. [33]
