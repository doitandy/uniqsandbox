Trends of 2026: Survival of the Tangible ||| Business Trends ||| Looking at 2026 trends, services without substance will vanish. Only facility-based industries or professions with philosophical and symbolic value will survive. Brand value comes from morality; false messages no longer work. [1], [2]
Microsoft's Secret: No New Features ||| Innovation ||| The secret to Microsoft's innovation was the "No New Features" policy. They focused on 'connection' and 'expansion' instead (e.g., VS Code). We cannot solve problems with the same thinking we used when we created them. [2], [3]
Trader Joe's Strategy: Selling Trust ||| Marketing Strategy ||| Trader Joe's acts as a buying agent for customers, not a seller. They focus on human interaction over technology and maintain offline exclusivity. If you are prepared as a producer, you don't need to rush to sell. [4]
Sales Logic: Price vs Cost ||| Sales ||| When a customer hesitates, ask: "Are you worried about the price or the cost?" Good salespeople enjoy winning arguments and sell value over price. Don't sell the product; sell the profit and the solution. [2]
Conflict Resolution for Leaders ||| Leadership ||| The key to eliminating conflict is to admit and resolve it publicly and honestly. Leaders must clearly communicate the benefits of their achievements. Unconditional humility is not the answer in business; strategic visibility is. [5], [6]
Price Decoding: The End of Cost-Plus ||| Economics ||| The era of "Price Decoding"—simply adding a margin to the cost—is over. You must sell experience, philosophy, and curation. If you are not making money, you are failing to provide value. [2]
Copywriting is Psychology ||| Marketing ||| Copywriting is psychology. Stimulate the customer's desires to make them look, believe, and buy. It is not about "what you say," but "who you are giving what to." [7], [8]
Headline Rule: 15 Characters ||| Writing Tips ||| Paint pictures with words. Titles should be concise (around 15 chars). Use "Teasing" (hide the subject) and "Nudge" (unexpectedness). Example: "Late. Running. Police blocking." [9], [10]
The Power of Silent Content ||| Social Media ||| On social media like Instagram, "silent content" works. Visuals combined with short, powerful messages create impact. Don't explain; show. [11], [12]
AI Strategy: Curation over Creation ||| AI Trends ||| AI reads patterns, not just text. In the future, content creation will be about "curation" and "questions" rather than raw generation. The one who asks the best questions will lead. [3], [13]
Micro-Niche Monopoly ||| Branding ||| Be unique. If you are small, dominate a micro-niche. A brand is formed when you narrow your customer range in a monopoly-strong sector. Don't be a generic commodity; be a specific solution. [14], [15]
Handling Customer Complaints ||| Customer Service ||| Speed is key in handling complaints. Admitting a mistake quickly often turns a crisis into an opportunity. Defensiveness leads to a bad reputation. Acknowledge, resolve, and move on. [16]
Negotiation: No Free Concessions ||| Negotiation ||| Negotiate with facts and objective standards. Do not make "free concessions." Make the other party feel grateful for your concession. If there is no plan B, do not stand on the edge of a cliff. [17]
Viral Keywords Strategy ||| Marketing ||| Use keywords like "Reason," "Free," "Warning," or "Only for Locals." Curiosity drives clicks. Negativity often attracts more attention than positivity, but use it wisely to verify facts. [9], [18]
Writing Rhythm: 3-4-3-4 ||| Writing ||| Shorten your sentences. Rhythm matters (3-4-3-4 beats). Drop unnecessary particles. If you want to be read, be brief. If you want to be believed, be specific. [19]
Google's Strategy: Free Access ||| Tech Strategy ||| Google released Android for free to capture the search and ad market. Strategy requires giving something away for free to gain data. Ask yourself: What can I offer for free to gather data? [3]
The 5 Whys Technique ||| Thinking ||| Ask "Why?" five times to find the root cause. Understand the flow and context. Smart people ask questions to uncover the essence, not just to get an answer. [20], [21]
Build in Public ||| Strategy ||| Share your failures and your process. People trust the journey more than the result. "Building in public" creates authority and authentic connection. [22]
Zero Click Era ||| 2026 Trend ||| The "Zero Click" era is coming. Users want answers without clicking. Your content must be optimized for AI summaries and direct answers. [2]
The Power of Questions ||| Communication ||| The quality of your life depends on the quality of your questions. Instead of "What do you like?", ask "I like this, how about you?" Good questions lead to good answers. [11], [20]
